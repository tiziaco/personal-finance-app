    GDPR Note:
    - This model uses soft delete (not anonymization) because:
      1. It doesn't contain personal data (just metadata: ID, user_id, name)
      2. Actual messages are in LangGraph checkpointing (separate storage)
      3. We can keep business records for analytics (non-personal)
    
    - When user requests deletion:
      1. Hard delete all message data from LangGraph checkpointing
      2. Soft delete these conversation records
      3. Anonymize the User record
    
    - The user_id foreign key remains valid after User anonymization
      (FK points to anonymized User record)

    Attributes:
        id: The primary key (conversation ID used in LangGraph)
        user_id: Foreign key to the user (remains valid after anonymization)
        name: Name of the conversation — cleared on user deletion (may contain PII)
        created_at: When the conversation was created (from BaseModel)
        updated_at: Last time the conversation was updated (auto-managed by BaseModel)
        deleted_at: When the conversation was soft deleted (from SoftDeleteMixin)
        user: Relationship to the conversation owner
